# Overview

This tutorial guides users through the planning and discovery phase for enabling observability and management (O&M) for Oracle E-Business Suite (EBS) on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI). Specifically, it focuses on EBS workloads that are currently on-premises. We'll cover how to perform an environment discovery and guide you in selecting the most suitable solution architecture from the available options. Additionally, we will explain the importance of each detail collected during this process to ensure a smooth transition and integration.


# General Environment Details

Understanding the EBS version being used and collecting the EBS URL is essential, as this information may be needed to enable synthetic monitoring later and also ensure that we are using
a supported version of EBS.
  	 	 
| EBS Version | EBS URL | 
|---------------|-------------|
| 12.2.11 | https://your-ebs-url.com  | 


# Database Details	 

Collecting EBS database details is essential to enable Observability & Management for EBS Databases. We would use these details with OCI O&M Stack monitoring service which provides simplified discovery for Oracle Databases. With Stack monitoring Service we can discover external databases (outside OCI), both single-instance Oracle Databases and Oracle RAC instances, including the DB System using the Stack Monitoring service. The entire db system is discovered as part of an Oracle Database discovery.
After deploying and configuring the Management Agents,  we can discover WebLogic Domain and Oracle Database with minimum input parameters â€“ these parameters basically ask for resource name, connection details and monitoring credentials.   Once discovery is complete, monitoring automatically starts. Having these details collected beforehand would be a good start.

Service that need these details:
- Database Management Service
- Stack Monitoring Service

| DB System | DB Type | DB Name | DB User Name | CDB/PDB Details | Port | Service Name | DNS hostname or SCAN name | 
|------------|---------|---------|---------------|----------|------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| Exadata (on-prem) | 19C | EBSDEV | dbsnmp (user role: Normal or SYSDBA ?) | EBSCDB/EBSPDB | 1521 | ebs_dev |  |       

| DB Host names | System IP's | Platform |
|--------------|------------|-------------|
| exadata001.domain.com | 10.1.x.x | Linux |
| exadata002.domain.com | 10.2.x.x | Linux |
| exadata003.domain.com | 10.3.x.x | Linux |

# Application Server Details

Host details are needed to install OCI management agents. Set Permissions on certain log locations
to collect logs for OCI log analytics service.
We also provision APM agents to setup Application Performance monitoring distributed tracing
for applications.

Service that need these details:
- Application Performance Monitoring
- Stack Monitoring Service
- Management Agent Installation
- OCI logging analytics Service

| Application HostName |	IP Address	| OS Version |	Java Version |
|------------------------|---------------|------------|---------------|
 | Host001 |	10.1.x.x	| Oracle Solaris 11.4 SPARC |	1.8.0_282 |
 | Host002 |	10.2.x.x	| Oracle Solaris 11.4 SPARC	| 1.8.0_282 |
 | Host003 |	10.3.x.x	| Oracle Solaris 11.4 SPARC	| 1.8.0_282 |
 | Host004 |	10.4.x.x	| Oracle Solaris 11.4 SPARC	| 1.8.0_282 |
 | Host005 |	10.5.x.x	| Oracle Solaris 11.4 SPARC	| 1.8.0_282 |

# Weblogic Details

For APM we need to deploy APM jar file on the weblogic console and add arguments for
OAFM and OACORE managed servers.

Service that need these details:
- Application Performance Monitoring
- Stack Monitoring 

| Weblogic Host | Weblogic Port | Weblogic Protocol | Weblogic username |
|---------------|-------------|---------------|-------------|
| 12.2.11 | 7001               | t3/t3s           | weblogic |

# Network Details

If customers on-prem network has a proxy or a firewall then we would need to use that and add it to our .rsp files during management gateway or management agent installations.

| Proxy Details | OCI Connection type |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Host: company.proxy.com port: 80 | Fastconnect/IPSec VPN/Direct Internet |


# Summary

This conversation should be done at the early stages before enablement. This can be a very useful record for the current implementation and future references.

# Next Steps

We will look at different solution architectures that can be leveraged while enabling EBS monitoring.
